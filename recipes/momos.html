    <div><ul>
        <li>Take 1 cup all-purpose flour, ¼ teaspoon salt and ½ teaspoon
             oil in a bowl. Mix well with a spoon.</li>
         <li> Add 2 to 3 tablespoon water in parts and begin to 
            knead to a firm dough. Do not make the dough soft 
            as then it becomes difficult to shape the dumplings.
        </li>
        <li>Cover the dough with a moist 
            napkin or kitchen towel. Let the dough rest for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Finely chop the vegetables. You will need 1.5 to 1.75
                 cups of finely chopped veggies. You can also use a 
                food processor to finely chop vegetables 
                like cabbage, carrots, french beans.</li>
